# Software Construction and Design Principles

This repository contains the labs which I completed in the Software Construction course at UC Riverside, uploaded with the consent of the instructor. Each lab and assignment has a readme with information necessary to understand the specs and the correspoding code.

The labs covered topics ranging from version control to design patterns, with each building off the last.

The design patterns covered are:
  * Strategy Pattern
  * Composite Pattern
  * Decorator Pattern
  * Factory Pattern
  * Visitor Pattern
